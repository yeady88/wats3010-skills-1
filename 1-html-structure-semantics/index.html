                    <p>paragraph: Let us consider for a moment what most of the trouble and anxiety which I have
                        referred to is about, and how much it is necessary that we be troubled, or, at least,
                        careful. It would be some advantage to live a primitive and frontier life, though in the
                        midst of an outward civilization, if only to learn what are the gross necessaries of
                        life and what methods have been taken to obtain them; or even to look over the old
                        day-books of the merchants, to see what it was that men most commonly bought at the
                        stores, what they stored, that is, what are the grossest groceries. For the improvements
                        of ages have had but little influence on the essential laws of manâ€™s existence; as our
                        skeletons, probably, are not to be distinguished from those of our ancestor</p>

                    <p>
                        paragraph: I cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may
                        get clothing. The condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of
                        the English; and it cannot be wondered at, since, as far as I have heard or observed,
                        the principal object is, not that mankind may be well and honestly clad, but,
                        unquestionably, that corporations may be enriched. In the long run men hit only what
                        they aim at. Therefore, though they should fail immediately, they had better aim at
                        something high.

                <h3>Self Reliance</h3>
                <h4>Emerson Uses Abstraction</h4>
                <article>
                    <p>Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence
                        has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have
                        always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their
                        perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their
                        hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind
                        the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards
                        fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty
                        effort, and advancing on Chaos and the Dark.</p>

                    <p>These are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter
                        into the world. Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of everyone of its
                        members. Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing
                        of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue
                        in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and
                        creators, but names and customs.</p>
